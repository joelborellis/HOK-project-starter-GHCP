[← Back to README](./README.md) · [Next: Day 2 →](./Day-2.md)

## Session 1: Welcome/Introductions and goals for the 3-day engagement (1 hour)

**Narrative**: The SE and customer teams establish the business problem and use case they are going to solve during the 3-day engagement.

- **Led by**: SE Dev Crew
- **Required participants**: All — business and technical participants
- **Goal**: Establish the business problem the team is going to tackle
- **Output**: Narrative document describing the business problem (used later during constitution and specification development)

## Session 2: Introduction to specification-driven development

**Narrative**: SE teams deliver.

_TODO: Expand this section (why specs, how to iterate, what “done” looks like)._ 

## Session 3: Defining the principles of the customer project (1 hour)

**Narrative**: Constitution (`Agents.md`) — define the things for this code-with project that the customer wants to establish as the starting point. These are non-negotiable principles for the project.

The elements defined in the constitution are non-negotiable; as you establish specifications/plans/tasks, always follow these requirements.

**Examples**:

- “Always assume deployment will be to Azure.”
- “Packages used should be Azure specific.”

**Session details**:

- **Led by**: SE Dev Crew
- **Required participants**: All — business and technical participants
- **Goal**: Establish project principles used to create the constitution (`Agents.md`)
- **Output**: List of project principles
