[← Back to README](../README.md) · [Next: Day 2 →](../Day_2/Day-2.md)

## Session 1: Welcome/Introductions and goals for the 3-day engagement (1 hour)

**Narrative**: The SE and customer teams establish the business problem and use case they are going to solve during the 3-day engagement.

**Session details**:

- **Led by**: SE Dev Crew
- **Required participants**: All — business and technical participants
- **Goal**: Establish the business problem the team is going to tackle
- **Output**: Narrative document describing the business problem (used later during constitution and specification development)

TODO: Add Powerpoint deck for this session.  And sample Output document that describes the business problem.

## Session 2: Introduction to specification-driven development (1 hour)

**Narrative**: SE teams deliver an overview of Spec-Driven Development and SpecKit to the customer technical specialists and developers. This session introduces the key concepts of Spec-Driven Development and how SpecKit supports the process. Also a walkthrough of this repo structure and artifacts.

**Session details**:

- **Led by**: SE Dev Crew
- **Required participants**: All — business and technical participants
- **Goal**: Familiarize the customer team with Spec-Driven Development and SpecKit and how it will be used during the engagement

TODO: Add Powerpoint deck for this session.

## Session 3: Defining the principles of the customer project (1 hour)

**Narrative**: Constitution (`Agents.md`) — define the things for this code-with project that the customer wants to establish as the starting point. These are non-negotiable principles for the project.

The elements defined in the constitution are non-negotiable; as you establish specifications/plans/tasks, always follow these requirements.  This is used by the coding agents to ensure the code produced meets the customer's needs.

**Examples**:

- “Always assume deployment will be to Azure.”
- “Packages used should be Azure specific.”
- "An interactive webside with minimal dependencies"

**Session details**:

- **Led by**: SE Dev Crew
- **Required participants**: All — business and technical participants
- **Goal**: Establish project principles used to create the constitution (`Agents.md`)
- **Output**: List of project principles aligned with the customers business and technical needs as described in Session 1

TODO: Add Powerpoint deck for this session.  Include sample constitution items.

## Session 4: Deeper dive on Specify, Plan, Clarify, Tasks, and Implement (1 hour)

**Narrative**: The SE Dev Crew will walk through the `Specify -> Plan -> Clarify -> Tasks -> Implement` steps of the project. They will explain how each step works and how they fit together to produce working code from customer requirements.

**Session details**:

- **Led by**: SE Dev Crew
- **Required participants**: Technical specialists and coders
- **Goal**: Define the plans for each of the specifications
- **Output**: Necessary inputs to the plans for each of the three (3) specifications

TODO: Add Powerpoint deck for this session.  Include sample specification, plan, clarify, tasks, and implement artifacts.
